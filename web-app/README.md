# Web App

This is the web app part of the SDUI showcase. It demonstrates how it will use the server to display the UI.
## Getting Started

To install run:

```
npm ci
```

`web-app` relies on two local packages which will need to be linked first before running this app.

To link these packages run the following:

```
npm link @csmets/generated-types
```

and

```
npm link @csmets/tokens
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
