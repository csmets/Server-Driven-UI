# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security is an important matter. Whilst this project is a guide on how to implement Server-Driven UI,
discoverying a flaw that can lead to security concerns should be raised and discussed. This will help
the community prevent potential gaps within this paradigm

If you happen to find an issue, please raise an issue as a bug and detail the concerns.
