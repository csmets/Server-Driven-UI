# Writing schema for clients

This document is a guideline when it comes to writing up a schema for your client applications.

## Design first

Before you can start writing a schema it is best to first have a design of a component first that will be used as reference. Schemas can be quickly become annoying to change once it has been deployed to an environment, and is preferred to be well thought out before it gets released to an environment. However, I don't mean that it requires to be feature complete, it can also be worked on iteratively, but should not change existing fields within the schema design.
